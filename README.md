## Simple Questions

**Do i get VacBan or is a Cheat?**
- No, this bot is used with **Steam Modules**, it's the same as **Steam App** for your Windows, the difference is that Simulate the games.

**Is this Bot saving Information about my Account?**
- No, You can only enter your **Username** and **Password** into the Console Prompt, this details are secure, and nobody can get them.
- Yes, Or you can choose where to save, in const **settings** (Remove // on **Username/Password Array** and add **// on Username/Password Const**) and fill your details, (for me is better prompt)

**Have the Creator or the Community Access?**
- No, this Bot is running in your **Localhost** (your pc).



## Let's Beggin

Install the NodeJs from https://nodejs.org/en/
Open your **CMD Prompt**

Use **npm** to install the necessary  modules:

npm install steam-user

npm install steamcommunity

npm install fs

npm install readline-sync

npm install request

npm install chalk

## Let's Start the bot
Note: the **config.json** file was changed, now you don't need to enter your username or password. Only on the CMD.. Easy way to move or save files.

- To add **new games** go to the appbot.js file on line **"games": [739630]** and change the "739630" with game codes by "739630, 739630, 739630".
- You can get them from the link when you search a game on market http://steamcommunity.com/app/730 -> **730** ==  CS:GO.

Use **node appBot.js** to start your bot
