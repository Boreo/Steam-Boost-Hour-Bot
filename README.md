## Simple Questions

**Do you get VAC or is a Cheat?**
- No, this bot is used with **Steam Modules & NODEJS**, it's the same as **Steam Auth App** for your Windows, but the difference is that Simulate the games.

**Is this Bot saving Information about my Account?**
- No, it does not save user credentials to disk or any persistent storage cloud.

**Have the Creator or the Community Access?**
- No, this Bot is running in your **Localhost** (your pc) and your details cannot be Tracked.

**In future updates will the credentials be saved or else?**
- No, my goal is to prevent any hacking located on the scripts or other types of saving credentials. Unfortunately i cannot control if someone copy and edit the script and use by his choice.
- In the future i believe i will find better ways to protect and make sure that every credential on the prompt are deleted after success login.

## Let's Beggin
- Install the packages using the file "install.bat".
- After installed, check carefully if everything is updated.
- Click on "start.bat" to iniciate your bot.

## Let's Start the bot
- To add **new games** insert on CMD called "GamesID (comma-separated)" with game-codes like "739630, 739630, 739630".
- Login using your credencials securely. *(If vacbanned, choose YES to proceed)*
  
Codes: You can get them from the link when you search a game on market http://steamcommunity.com/app/730 -> **730** ==  CS:GO.

That's it!

Note: You can only idle 25 games per Account/Bot. Idling more than 25 Games will automaticly Bug your Steam Game Hours.
Note 2: It is possible now to login with VacBan accounts, but remember, it's yor account, your choice.
