## ‚ö†Ô∏è AVOID THE ORIGINAL REPOSITORY; USE THIS SECURE FORK INSTEAD

This is a secure and improved fork of the [Steam-Boost-Hour-Bot](https://github.com/SwayerPT/Steam-Boost-Hour-Bot) by [SwayerPT](https://github.com/SwayerPT).  

The **original version has serious security issues**, including storing your Steam credentials in plain text while falsely claiming they are encrypted. This fork fixes those flaws and prioritises your account safety.

### My Attempts to Address the Issue:
- I raised two issues in the original repository to notify the maintainer about the security risk.
- Both issues were deleted after the maintainer responded dismissively, saying:

> Friend, don't be rube like that saying, the bot is secure anyway and is working as should. Yes, is not encrypting as should to the plain text because I am developing that part, and is not completed yet. You can still using the before releases to be more secure if you'd like.  
> Anyway, the bot still secure logging and keeping the details in your local txt file, because is in your PC/Localhost. This days is hard to steal a steam account, because you have more aways to use T2F.  
> That's not the point.

Despite acknowledging that credentials are not encrypted, the maintainer continues to claim in the README that they are. This gives users a false sense of security and puts their Steam accounts at risk.
